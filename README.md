## Do you want to know my story?

<details>
  <summary>My story</summary><br>
  
  ### First of all
  
  It all started when I was 8 years old. 
  I was always an ambitious nerd, as you would say today, always paying attention and knowing quite a lot at my age. 
  In computer science lessons we did topics that always interested me. 
  A year later I started playing Minecraft. With private friends we played about 4 hours a day on cracked servers because we didn't have an original minecraft :0.
  I started getting interested in how such a server is created, what you need, etc. At that time, I wrote to a team member on Twerion how the whole thing works, I was   also on the Minesucht TS and went to the team members addiction channel every day and asked if anyone knew. Finally I found someone who explained it all to me pretty   well (At the time I could only create a spigot server :0).
  A few months later I already had a finished bungee cord network. Back then, the lobby system was the most important.
  After that, a developer taught me the CloudNET system and we already had a cloud.
  And then I got interested in plugins.
  
  ### How i start to code
  
  Most of my disco
  
  As already mentioned, in 2018 I wanted to be able to program Minecraft plugins. I always watched the videos of Bievieh or Lombonz but I was too stupid to remember     that at the time. With my 91309 network I had a developer where we played truth or dare. His duty was to teach me how to code, which he eventually did. He programmed   something via Anydesk and I memorized it. I wrote the program what felt like 100 times and at the time I thought I was so crazy. I always increased my knowledge         through videos, courses, decompilation plugins, open source projects. Then comes the school. With the school I learned new things and I learnd more complex algorithms. Now I'm here, professional developer.
  
  ### How can I learn code?
  
  Most of my Discord messages are how can I learn to code
  
  The important thing is programming is constructive. Persistence, patience and learning-friendly is the most important thing. It may sound stupid (I get it, I don't     think it's cool either) but the best thing is a book. Most things are in a book. Believe me: With a book, YT tutorials you will become a developer very quickly.
